# IMDbExploratoryAnalysis-Movies
An exploratory data analysis of non-adult movies within IMDb's data repositories. This is intended as a demonstration of data analytics methods.

The workbook is intended to be used with the IMDb data from their non-commercial datasets, which can be found here: https://datasets.imdbws.com/ and described in detail here: https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/

Please review the Jupyter notebook file for initial data handling practices which were used to clean the massive dataset prior to diving into the final visualization which can be found within the following Tableau Public page: [(Page Pending).](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jacob.krol/viz/IMDbsMostPopularMoviesbyVote-weightedRatings/Dashboard1).
